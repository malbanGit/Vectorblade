; Useful constants for developing AtariVox applications with DASM.
; This is basically a DASM-readable version of pages 15 and 16 of the
; SpeakJet manual. The phoneme names were taken straight from the manual.
; The pause and control code names were assigned by me, but they're
; pretty obvious. Also, I'm adding descriptive aliases for the non-speech
; noises (e.g. SHOT = M1 (the "Pistol Shot").
; See "phrases.inc" for example usage.

; Control Codes Details:
;      0 - 6 = Pauses.
; Pauses of various durations, these will cause the volume to ramp down, wait a specified
; amount of time and the ramp back up.  1, 2 & 3, ramp the volume while the format
; frequencies are being changed. 4, 5 & 6 wait for silence before changing the format
; frequencies.
;  0 = 0ms   1 = 100ms   2 = 200ms  3 = 700ms
;  4 = 30ms    5 = 60ms   6 = 90ms
;  7 = Fast.
; Plays the next phoneme at 1/2 the time it normally would play.
;      8 = Slow
; Plays the next phoneme at 1 and 1/2 the time it normally would play.
;      14 = Stress.
; Plays the next phoneme with a small amount of stress in the voice.
;      15 = Relax
; Plays the next phoneme with a small amount of relaxation in the voice.
;  16 = Wait
; This command will stop the voicing and wait for a start command.  The Start command
; can be issued by either sending the SCP start command or by changing the state of one
; of the input lines that has been previously set to do a Start.
;  20 = Volume, X
; This command sets the master volume level.  A value will need to be sent after the
; volume command that specifies the desired volume. Volume levels can range from 0 to
; 127.  The default is 96.
;  21 = Speed, X
; This command sets the play speed.  A value will need to be sent after the speed
; command that specifies the desired speed.  Speeds can range from 0 to 127. The
; default is 114.
;  22 = Pitch, X
; This command sets the Vocalization Pitch in Hertz.  A value will need to be sent after
; the pitch command that specifies the desired pitch. The vocalization pitch is what makes
; a voice sound High pitched or Low pitched.  For singing, the pitch has a range of 3 full
; octaves (32Hz to 240hz).  The Vocalization Pitch works only on sounds that are voiced.
; Pitches can range from 0 to 255.  The default is 88. Note that anything under 30 starts
; to sound like clicks instead of a voice.  Also Note that a value of 0 = 0 Hz and thusly, will
; not actually vocalize.
;
; 23 = Bend, X
; This command sets the frequency Bend.  A value will need to be sent after the Bend
; command that specifies the desired Bend. The frequency Bend adjusts the output
; frequencies of the oscillators. This will change the voicing from a deep-hollow sounding
; voice to a High-metallic sounding voice. Bends can range from 0 to 15.  The default is 5.
;      24 = PortCtr, X
; This command sets the Port Control Value.  A value will need to be sent after the
; PortCtr command that specifies the desired function of the output lines.  The Output line
; control bits are binaurally encoded where a 1 indicates that the output function is chip
; controlled and a 0 indicates that the output function is user controlled. Bit 0 corresponds
; to OUT0, etc... PortCtr values can range from 0 to 7.  The default is 7.
;  25 = Port, X
; This command sets the Port Output Value.  A value will need to be sent after the Port
; command that specifies the desired state of the output lines. When the Output line
; control bits are set to 0, the corresponding port bit is represented on the output line. Bit
; 0 corresponds to OUT0, etc... Port values can range from 0 to 7.  The default is 0.
;  26 = Repeat, X
; This command sets a number of times to Repeat the next code.  A value will need to be
; sent after the Repeat command that specifies the number of times to repeat the next
; command.
; The Repeat range is from 0 to 255.
;  28 = Call Phrase, X
; This command specifies which EEPROM phrase to play then to return from.
; This can be nested 3 deep maximum.
;  29 = Goto Phrase, X
; This command specifies which EEPROM phrase to play.
;  30 = Delay, X
; This command specifies the number of 10ms intervals to delay before continuing
; on to the next code. The Delay range is from 0 to 255.
;  31 = Reset
; This command resets the Volume, Speed, Pitch and Bend to the default values.
