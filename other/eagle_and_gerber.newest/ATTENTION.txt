The NAND chip on the PCB is about 1/2 a millimeter to near to
the spacer of the (standard) Sean Kelly cartridge.

If you use this exact PCB you have to shave off a little bit of
the said spacer in order to properly close the cartridge.

I only discovered this after I ordered more than 100 PCB's and the
shaving is done in a second - so I never changed the design.
