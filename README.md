# Vectorblade

These are all ressources for "Vectorblade" a Vectrex game and port of the good old "Warblade".

To build it you <b>need</b> Vide, since the game consists of four seperated banks and address information "over" banks is injected into each 
bank-binary by Vide in an additional "linker" stage.

Vide is a VECTREX INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (http://vide.malban.de), it is free and can be downloaded for several OS at the given homepage.
