; Variables
;
; These routines require 2 bytes of RAM for the following variable:
;
; vox_addr - 16-bit pointer to next byte in speech string.
;
; You may wish to comment out the following lines and declare vox_addr
; elsewhere in your code.

;
; vox_init
; --------
;
; Function:
;       Prepare joystick port for serial transmission and initialize
;       speech string pointer.
;
; Usage:
;       Call vox_init once at the start of your program.
;
; Note:
;       This routine writes $ef to PSG register 14 by calling Exec ROM
;       routine WRREG ($f256).  This is to mask serial output from all
;       joystick pins except the data line. (Port 2, pin 1.)
;       Care should be taken to not overwrite this register.  (There's
;       normally no reason to do so.)
;
; Caution:
;       The dp register will be set to $d0.

; test if there is a vecVox, by filling its buffer to overflow and if it
; gives a "buffer full" we know its there
; this does not work!  - at least not with atari vecVox

                    rts      

;
; vox_speak
; ---------
;
; Function:
;       Sends speech data to the VecVox.
;
; Usage:
;       Call vox_speak once per frame. (I.e. stick it in your main loop)
;       See note below.
;
;       Then, just store the start address of a speech string in
;       vox_addr when you want the VecVox to speak, and let this
;       routine do the work!
;
;       To abort speech in progress, point vox_addr at vox_silence or
;       call vox_init2 (which does exactly that).
;
; Note:
;    1. This subroutine requires that the current joystick button
;       status is held at RAM address $c80f (TRIGGR).  This is usually
;       set by calling the Executive ROM routine INPUT (a.k.a.
;       read_switches2) at $F1BA.
;
;    2. Speech strings should be terminated with VOX_TERM. ($ff)
;
; Caution:
;       Contents of the dp register may (or may not) be set to $d0.
